        <h1>Pactsworn Dragoon: A Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Homebrew Subclass for Fighters</h1>
        <section class="main-section" id="Subclass_Description">
            <header>Subclass Description</header>
            <p>Halflings travel far and wide. In these adventures they form fast friendships with many different
                species. In this
                mixing a curious fighting style was formed, wherein the often smaller halfling ended up on the back of a
                kindly Goliath
                or Minotaur "just for a moment". Of course, the comfort, expedience, and safety of the arrangement was
                hard for the
                halfling to ignore. Their large friend similarly grew to enjoy the constant pair of eyes on his back and
                the occasional
                "lucky" strike enabled by his halfling friend. When the arrangement was made formal and the magic of the
                halfling
                enforced, the first Pactsworn Dragoons were born.</p>
            <p>Now these devastating fighters are a common fixture in many of the integrated frontiers of the north, and
                many a war has
                been turned by the heroic Dragoons and their empowered friends.</p>
            <p>Although this subclass was made with a halfling in mind, any small-sized character would do. Goblins,
                gnomes, fairies, ratfolk and more can all make excellent Pactsworn Dragoons.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Pactsworn_Ally">
            <header>Pactsworn Ally</header>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, an ally mounted by a Pactsworn Dragoon gains +5 Movement Speed, increasing to +10
                at level 11.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Mounted_Luck">
            <header>Mounted Luck</header>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you may use a Reaction to make a Help check for your mounted Ally.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Opportunistic_Strike">
            <header>Opportunistic Strike</header>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can take advantage of your allies tempo by striking immediately in the wake of
                their blow.
                Whenever a mounted ally hits with an attack and deals damage you can use a Reaction to make a single
                weapon attack
                against the same enemy.</p>
            <p>You can use your Opportunists Strike a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
                regain
                all expended uses
                when you finish a long rest.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Unerring_Luck">
            <header>Unerring Luck</header>
            <p>Starting at 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures
                nearby. If you or a
                creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction . Roll the
                die, and add
                the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has
                resistance against
                the attack's damage.</p>
            <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to Proficiency Modifier, and you regain all expended
                uses of it when
                you finish a long rest.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Foresight_of_the_Dragoon">
            <header>Foresight of the Dragoon</header>
            <p>Starting at 10th level your keen perception and lofty perch mean you and your mounted allies have
                Advantage on
                Initiative rolls and cannot be surprised as long as you are conscious.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Bonded_Souls">
            <header>Bonded Souls</header>
            <p>Starting at 15th level the bond between the you and your mounted ally is so powerful spells cannot
                distinguish between
                the two of them. While mounted on the ally, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also
                target the
                mounted ally as well. The mounted ally may do the same with you.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Undying_Loyalty">
            <header>Undying Loyalty</header>
            <p>Starting at 18th level, the bond between friends allows you to shrug off fatal blows.</p>
            <p>While you’re mounted, having 0 hit points doesn’t knock you unconscious. You still must make death saving
                throws, and
                you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to
                failing death
                saving throws, you don’t die until unseated or combat ends, and you die then only if you still have 0
                hit points.</p>

            <p><span id="Huberthion">Huberthion Strahgarius IV, known as the Lord of Shoulders, the Deltquestrian,
                    lets loose a battle cry.
                    His
                    rapier flashes downward and sinks into the grey, partially decomposed flesh of a revenant.
                    Huberthion
                    quickly resets his stance from
                    atop the
                    shoulders
                    of his tall human friend. As the revenant stumbles back from the sword strike, Huberthion's noble
                    steed
                    surges forward and swings an enchanted maul at the undead abomination.</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Race: Halfling. The halfling's ability scores line up nicely for the Pactsworn Dragoon. Plus, the
                    halfling
                    luck feature is always welcome. </li>
                <li>Ability Scores: Strength can be an excellent ability score to invest in, especially
                    if you wish to play a character who wields a strength-based weapon such as a lance. However,
                    Huberthion is a dexterity-based fighter, so we will invest in dexterity as our primary ability,
                    followed by consitution. </li>
                <li>Skills: With such high Dexterity and our character fighting from atop their bipedal steed, we'll
                    take Acrobatics. The second skill is up to you, for whatever best fits your character.</li>
                <li>Background: Huberthion is a Knight, so we will take that. It gives him proficiency in history and
                    persuasion. Feel free to pick any background that suits your character concept or intended role.
                </li>
                <li>Feats: Mounted Combatant is a must at fourth level. It will give us advantage on melee attacks rolls
                    against creatures smaller than our mount. It will also allow us to force attacks targeted against
                    our mount to hit us instead. Our mount will take half damage on failed Dexterity saving throws and
                    no damage on successful Dexterity saving throws. Besides Mounted Combatant, it is a good idea to
                    increase your primary combat score. Huberthion's is dexterity. Additional feats that can be
                    effective are great weapon master and polearm master. The Lucky feat is always fun and thematic with
                    our character concept of an aged halfling knight. </li>
